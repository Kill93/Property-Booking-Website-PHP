# Property-Booking-Website-PHP

This was a college assignment for a property booking website. I used the Codeignitor framework to write the application in PHP. This was hosted on XAMPP for running locally, connecting to an Apache Server and MySQL database via PHPMyAdmin. Customer payments were processed through PayPal which was integrated into the system.
